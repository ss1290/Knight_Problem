Build a chessboard-based knight movement engine in React Native. Requirements: N×N board (default 8×8, configurable),
accept a starting position, calculate all valid knight moves, boundary
validation, separate logic from visualisation, highlight knight position
and valid moves. Please create the full project structure, the pure-logic
engine, all UI components, and the required README.
